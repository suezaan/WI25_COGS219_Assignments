## Strengths and weaknesses of the original figure. 

- Strengths:
  1. It shows the full distribution of subjects in each dataset (e.g., HC, SIMD, MDD-1)
  2. It uses different color for different networks making easier to distinguish.


- Weaknesses:
  1. Y-axis range is not identical in the first "Salience" network plot, so there's a chance that it might exaggerate the group difference 
  2. Yellow circle in "Fronto-parietal" network plot is not very visible, so it would be better for me to use different color.
  3. With the same y-axis range, it would be nice to collapse the plots into a single plot for avoiding redundancy. 

- Sidenote: Original dataset and code for visualizing were not provided. Instead, I decided to adapt our lab's data and see if I can reproduce the figure!

## Instruction

Data: demographics & brain scans for 10 subjects (3 with Tourette Syndrome Diagnosis and 7 with non-Tourette Syndrome Diagnosis)

Hereafter, Tourette Syndrome = TS

Goal: plot the size of a certain brain functional network relative to total cortex surface area (%) (e.g., Default Mode Network takes up 10% of total cortex surface area)

End result: a plot that shows how different are TS vs. non-TS subjects in terms of functional brain network sizes? 


## Data prep

```{r}
# bring in data directly from github repository
data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suezaan/WI25_COGS219_Assignments/main/Figure%20Assignment/FigAssign_data.csv")
data
```

```{r}
# change column names for later visualization
  # columns 1~8 are demographics
  # columns 9~28 are names of functional brain networks
colnames(data)[colnames(data) == "Default_Parietal"] <- "Default-Parietal"
colnames(data)[colnames(data) == "CinguloOpercular/Action-mode"] <- "Cingulo-opercular"
colnames(data)
```

```{r}
# specify networks of interest and a long format data
network_columns <- c(16, 28, 20, 15)

data_long <- data %>%
  select(Group, all_of(network_columns)) %>%  
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Group,  
    names_to = "Network",
    values_to = "Value"
  )
data_long
```

## Plot
```{r p, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Group, y = Value, color = Network)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = Network), alpha = 0.3, size = 1.5) +  
  stat_summary( 
    fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", 
    geom = "errorbar", 
    width = 0.2, 
    size = 0.35, 
    color = "black"  # error bar
  ) +  
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean, 
    geom = "point", 
    shape = 21,  
    size = 3,    
    aes(fill = Network, color = Network),  
    stroke = 1    # mean stat   
  ) +  
  facet_wrap(~ Network, scales = "fixed", ncol = 4) +  # nrow = 5 for 4 x 5 format (in case of bringing all the networks on the plot)
  labs(
    x = "Group",
    y = "% Cortex",
    title = "Network Size Across Groups"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", margin = margin(b = 20)),
    axis.line = element_line(linewidth = 0.5),  # axis line width
    panel.spacing = unit(1.5, "lines"),  # space between plots 
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.4, margin = margin(b = 20))  
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 20))  # set y-axis limits  
plot(p)
```

## Report

Addressed weaknesses 

  1. Y-axis range is not identical in "Salience" network plot, so there's a chance that it might exaggerate the group difference 
  -> set y-axis limit [0, 20] 
  
  2. Yellow circle in "Fronto-parietal" network plot is not very visible, so it would be better for me to use different color.
  -> colors are already visible with default palette
  
  3. With the same y-axis range, it would be nice to collapse the plots into a single plot for avoiding redundancy. 
  -> collapsed 4 plots together so that it shows 1 x-axis and 1 y-axis 
  
The END.
